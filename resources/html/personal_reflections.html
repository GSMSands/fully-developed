    <p>Personally, while reflecting on the group, everyone was quite kind and
      thoughtful towards each other, but it took some time to work each
      other out due to each other's introverted ways. The way tasks were
      assigned worked quite well, and everything was completed when they
      were meant to be and to a high degree of standard.
      <br><br>
      There were some small challenges; for instance, the file structure in
      teams was a little messy and hectic at times with so many different
      tabs for different things. Another thing was we are all so kind that
      we have a little trouble being critical towards each other without
      feeling bad for doing so. Another way we could improve is that we should
      have set up something like a master task list early on because personally,
      I found having something visual with everything that needed doing on it
      to be extremely helpful.
      <br><br>
      Overall, the group works very well together and seems to be willing to
      move the earth to help each other out and help each other learn. The
      communication between each other was well done, and everyone knew what
      they needed to get done and also knew that support if needed.

    <p>Reflecting upon my perception of the group, I would say that it
      has so far been a positive experience. Everyone in the group has a
      friendly attitude and were easy to talk to during team meetings.
      I felt as though everyone was respectful of each other during team
      chats as well as in meetings, and everyone’s voice was able to be heard.
      Team members would c heck on each other’s well-being, as well as
      offering help and guidance.
      <br><br>
      Elements that presented small challenges were perhaps not having all of
      the processes and management techniques in place from the get-go to keep
      to all the deadlines. I think we needed better visualisation of our
      overall timelines to keep the group on track. We were at times very
      idealistic about how much we could achieve in certain time frames. I
      think for our future assessments, extensive use of detailed timelines,
      checklists, and Kanban boards will eliminate the challenges in this area.
      <br><br>
      Further areas where we could improve as a team is to divide larger
      tasks into smaller groups rather than assigning one person to large
      tasks. This is a way to challenge each other’s work in a constructive
      way when co-writing a document or an element of the project. This, in
      turn, helps us to sharpen our skills and improve faster.
      <br><br>
      Overall, the group is very conscientious and willing to help each other
      to achieve our collective goals.

    <p>Personally, my overall perception of this group was mostly positive.
      While it took a little longer for everyone to understand each other’s
      personalities and habits due to our introversion, I felt that everyone
      genuinely desired to complete the work to a high degree. Although there
      were some hiccups regarding deadlines and miscommunication, tasks were
      then assigned in a proper manner and completed on time. Due to varying
      skills and talents, the group could have discussed more about individual
      strengths and weaknesses. Regardless of this, it was great to see mentorship
      and general offerings of help being asked and given. I believe that group
      members learn best this way.
      <br><br>
      The general attitude and mood was positive and uplifting. Even though there
      were physical limitations, I felt that bonds were created through this
      groupwork as everyone participated frequently. I was genuinely encouraged
      by the fact that we had similar struggles in our daily life and that I am
      not alone in this course.
      <br><br>
      As a group, I felt that we can improve more by encouraging critical thinking.
      For example, when Gesina and I worked on an essay together, we challenged
      each other’s thought processes and debated about topics which helped expand
      our knowledge. Having a colleague co-write resulted in a better-written
      essay than if it were to be written solely by one person.

    <p>As a group, we came together early; we identified each other through
      interactions on the Canvas and quickly bonded over our shared enthusiasm
      to learn. Despite a tendency to be introverted and many similarities
      across the team, we soon discovered we all came from various backgrounds
      and had a range of strengths to bring to the team. Each team member
      has been very generous with their strengths and lifted the overall
      expertise in the group.
      <br><br>
      Because we bonded so well socially, I think we missed an opportunity to
      clarify some outcomes early on. A few assumptions were made, which created
      confusion in the last couple of weeks of this assignment. However, with
      lots of open communication, we were able to get back on track relatively
      quickly.
      <br><br>
      One of the challenging and surprising things was the Microsoft teams.
      It was hard to keep up with the chat of 5 team members working across four
      different time zones. Throw in various other work/caring responsibilities,
      and it was easy to miss a whole day worth of conversation. Conversely,
      the document collaboration tools worked exceptionally well as we all
      worked on multiple documents. We did not have one single experience of a
      lost doc!
      <br><br>
      I’ve learned that study groups are different from work groups in that
      people don’t come in with preassigned roles. In a work group, you will
      generally have representatives from different parts of the organisation
      that logically take ownership of specific tasks. In the study scenario,
      that is not the case, and it would be helpful to put more effort into
      assigning roles at the start.

    <p>Our group ‘Fully-Developed’ quickly formed, and all members were very
      motivated to get into assignment 2. The use of Teams was an effective
      communication and collaboration tool as feedback was easy to give
      and receive. The was group was cohesive, supportive, and considerate
      towards each member.
      <br><br>
      The team’s use of the file/channel structure was quite organic, becoming
      quite complex, making it difficult to find some files. The same sort
      of problem was encountered with the use of the chat and discussion
      channels. When many people were contributing, it got complex and confusing
      to follow at times.
      <br><br>
      My surprise came from the working format, with people of different backgrounds,
      in different geographical locations and different IT strengths in an online
      environment. This sounded like a recipe for disaster, but we worked efficiently,
      as we all got along and supported each other.
      <br><br>
      Working ‘on’ the group is just as important as working ‘in’ the group. Meaning,
      it is important to get to know each member of the group to build trust and
      understand everyone’s expectations. This helps to work out how to use each
      member’s strength for the benefit of the group and be inclusive of each members
      learning journey.
