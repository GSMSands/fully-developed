    <h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h1><br><br>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are a digital asset or virtual currency that uses Blockchain technology
      to operate, secured by a cryptographic layer, making them almost impossible to copy and
      double-spend (Frankenfield, 2021). A Blockchain is essentially a unique type of database.
      Unlike a traditional database housed in a central computer, a Blockchain is distributed
      across a large network of computers each with its own record. Meaning, no one computer has
      central control of the blockchain. Each of these computers is referred to as a ‘node’. If
      a node were to fail, the blockchain would still function as the other nodes would still be
      able to operate the database (Conway, 2021).</p><br><br>

    <p>The blockchain stores data about transactions of value between peers on the network; as
      transactions are created, the data is stored within a block. As each block is completed ‘a
      hash code (hash) is created by a math function that takes digital information and generates
      a string of letters and numbers from it’ (Murray, 2018, para. 6) for its unique identification.
      Then each block is linked together in a chronological sequence called a chain that contains the
      current generated hash and the hash from the previous block. By doing this it has created a
      tamper-resistant, immutable record of the transaction, that is impossible to change. Any change
      to a completed block changes the hash created for the current and subsequent block, making it easy
      for malicious activities to be noticed (Murray, 2018). The distributed records need to be compared
      and validated for the current transaction across the network to be completed. This makes for
      secure transactions by building in peer-to-peer trust without the need for any third-party mediation
      (Yaga et al, 2018).</p><br><br>

    <p>A blockchain can either be private, used within an organisation, or public, used between organisations
      (IBM, n.d.). As well as the transactions being irreversible, the ledger of transactions is transparent,
      making it available to all parties involved. In order for a transaction of value to take place, public
      and private keys are required. These keys are like two halves of a digital signature. The keys are used
      to access a digital wallet to carry out transactions peer-to-peer. The public key is an address in the
      form of an alphanumeric code combination that is available for any other party to view and use. The private
      key is only to be used by the public key owner, like a pin number on a traditional bank account. In this,
      blockchain is decentralised, immutable, transparent and secure (Conway, 2021).</p><br><br>

    <p>Although blockchain has been around for quite a while, the uptake and use cases are just starting to
      take hold in various segments of the economy. The most significant uptake has been in transactions and
      payments through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A secondary market for cryptocurrencies has developed
      through smart contracts with the likes of Ethereum, and more recently Cardano (Shumba, 2021). They have
      built a platform to program in rules directly to a contract between two parties without the need for a
      mediating third party, which creates a peer-to-peer trust mechanism in a protocol for the transfer of
      value at an agreed point. Following this, a new fintech revolution has taken place with a new financial
      product called decentralised finance (Defi), also built upon the Ethereum ecosystem. This has created a
      flood of new cryptocurrencies that have use cases such as yield farming and lending services using currently
      owned tokens as either collateral or staking (Ketchell, 2021). A new digital asset class has emerged and
      seen a large take-up in adoption in 2020/21, which is the Non-Fungible Token (NFT). NFT’s are, in most cases,
      digital artworks in the form of an image, video or other digital asset that is unique (BBC News, 2021).
      Some early projects such as Crytopunks and Cryptokitties have exploded in popularity. One of the most expensive
      NFT ever sold was by the artist Beeple, whose piece titled ‘The first 5000 days’, sold for US$69 million (Finder
      2021).
    </P><br><br>

    <p>For cryptocurrencies, the next big movement will be institutional adoption and government regulation
      to protect investors and deter its use in criminal activities (Builtin, n.d). There are also nation-states
      looking at ways to bring the technology into their economies as a legitimate form of currency, El Salvador
      being the first country to do so (ABC, 2021). Blockchain will be used with other emerging technologies such
      as Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and agricultural
      technology to name, but a few (Daley, n.d.).</p><br><br>

    <br>

    <p>Blockchain has been mainly associated with cryptocurrencies and it has seen the most development in that
      space, yet there are a range of sectors globally that could benefit from their potential to generate economic
      growth as identified in a report from PwC. The key areas focus on healthcare, government and public services,
      manufacturing, finance, logistics and retail (PwC, 2020).</p><br><br>

    <p>Healthcare could see a secure database of medical records that could safely and efficiently be shared with
      authorised medical staff and patients alike, without the risks of attack that a central database would have
      (Spratz, 2018). Medical supplies and vaccines could be accurately tracked, monitoring origin of ingredients,
      production and shipping, a tool in the fight against counterfeit drug manufacturing (Peerbits, n.d.).</p><br><br>

    <p>Logistics and retail could see increased benefits through the use of blockchain technology with tracking and
      tracing product provenance in situations where a product may be faulty. A retailer/supplier/manufacturer would
      be able to use the blockchain records to target the point of failure by highlighting the batch and shipment
      numbers. Time-sensitive products like perishable food items and some medicines could be tracked through IoT
      devices attached to lot shipments. That could signal points of unsafe temperature fluctuations, for example,
      pinpointing areas for attention in an efficient manner (Gaur & Gaiha, 2020).</p><br><br>

    <p>With blockchain, being an emerging technology, a lot still needs to be done. This is especially clear in the
      cryptocurrency space, which has seen the most growth, but has also highlighted some of the issues for this
      space, with the lack of regulation, leaving it open to manipulation, and some issues with money laundering and
      criminal activities affecting the trustworthiness of cryptocurrencies (Gaur & Gaiha, 2021). Improvements with
      trust will bring institutional adoption that could severely disrupt the traditional financial sector as
      cryptocurrencies
      provide a new way to do finance, with conventional banks being made obsolete (Haar, 2021). Those who were
      previously
      unable to access banking services can now do so using a mobile phone, which could be the ticket that leads them
      out
      of poverty (Tarud, 2021).</p><br><br>

      <p><i><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Simple explanation of a transaction on the blockchain.</i> (Hutt, 2016)</p><br>

    </center>
    <br>

    <p>The future for blockchain and cryptocurrencies and its effects are somewhat unknown and difficult to predict.
      In many cases it may not have an obvious impact on family, friends and ourselves directly in day-to-day
      activities.
      We anticipate that the transition will be somewhat seamless for regular citizens, and the disruption would be
      minimised. I see that the most obvious benefits of a blockchain and cryptocurrencies will come in terms of new
      payment, investing and lending methods on offer to customers. Identity proof and transfer methods will improve
      as one identity record can be shared across multiple services, especially in health care and government services.
      Electronic voting may become viable as authentication can be linked directly to your identity record. Customers
      could shop and have information about the origin of the products or services they may purchase that consider
      environmental and human rights factors.</p><br><br>

    <p>The speed at which transactions can occur will increase significantly as intercountry transfers happen
      within seconds, with minimal fees incurred, passing savings back to the customer. The sale of large assets,
      like real estate, could be done on the spot without the need for a third party to mediate, it may just require
      an application where details are entered to generate a smart contract that would be effective from an agreed
      date and with certain conditions being met before an instant, verified, low fee and secure transaction
      taking place.</p><br><br>
