    <h1>Project Idea</h1><br><br>
    <h2><strong>Project Name: </strong>Wildlife Spotter</h2><br>
    <h3><strong>Format: </strong>Smart Phone App</h3><br><br>

    <h2>Overview</h2><br>

    <p>This application will help eco-tourism and wildlife conservation.
      With a user-generated account people are encouraged to take and
      upload pictures of their wildlife encounters in their local environment
      or holiday destinations. These pictures are date stamped and geolocated
      for the user community to view and react to. Informative content can be
      found on particular species to an area for possible on-the-spot
      identification, along with contacts to the nearest wildlife rescue
      services in the area of visitation. Eco-tourism-based advertising would
      drive the commercial viability of the application with suggestions made
      for accommodation, tours, restaurants and other activities for the user
      to view; with the latest content added or from a tagged map for general
      browsing and exploration.</p><br><br>

    <h2>Motivation</h2><br>
    <p>Several factors have added to the need for an application as we are
      proposing.</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Australians are becoming increasingly aware of the population
      and climate change’s impact on our wildlife, observing unprecedented
      weather events leading to droughts and bushfires. Coupled with a pandemic
      that has locked our borders limiting international and interstate travel,
      the tourism sector has taken a big hit. Once restrictions start to ease,
      domestic tourism will be the most viable option for Australian recreation
      and to get the economy back on its feet. People will be keen to leave the
      cabin fever of their houses and get amongst nature. When international
      borders open, this application could be a great Australian tourism
      marketing platform.</li><br>

        <li>As a result of the pandemic, many families are
      looking for more things to do in their own backyards.  Even in the humble
      suburban backyard, there are many animals to be found, however, it’s
      often difficult to identify them.  Our app will give users the opportunity
      to learn what’s already in their own backyard and learn how to support 
      them and encourage other wildlife into their spaces, with tips of native
      plants to grow.</li><br>

        <li>Organisations like Birdlife Australia are increasingly 
      using citizen science events like the Aussie Backyard Bird Count to help
      collect data on the number of birds in our environment.  The raw data 
      about which animals have been identified in each location collected
      from our app could be made available to research groups.</li><br>

        <li>This could be
      made commercially viable in various ways. There could be two versions, 
      a free version with ads and a paid version without ads, or we could also
      just simply be selling the data to research institutes so that end users
      aren’t paying but researchers, NGO’s and institutes are.</li><br><br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2><br>

    <p>New users would be greeted with an engaging landing page that leads to
       a registration form and invites them to create a unique wildlife avatar.
       The application would need permission to access the phone’s camera,
       photos and Global Positioning System (GPS) data with a disclaimer about
       user privacy.</p><br>

    <p>New users would be given an optional quick tutorial about
       how to use the app. With a text window version or a video overview to
       highlight key features. After the user has finished/skipped the tutorial
       they end up on their dashboard page with some options such as profile
       update, Gallery, etc.</p><br>

    <p>The dashboard will display their animal avatar,
       username (real or otherwise), their wildlife interests and their gaming
       stats to date, as well as any news updates. They can connect, compare
       and interact with other members through Spotters, Spots and Spotties.
       Spotters are other members that they can follow and be followed by.
       Spots are the number and variety of animals they have captured with
       their cameras. Spotties are the equivalent of a like, in the form of an
       animal emoji used to encourage and support other users.</p><br>

    <p>Spotters can be sourced in a couple of ways. New uploaded content of
       other Spotters will be featured on a member’s dashboard as a rotating
       slide show, with the ability to add Spotter follows. The other way is
       based on their preferences in their profile selections, suggestions will be made to
       them each week. Spot categories will be broken into some basic groupings
       like Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Insects, Amphibians, Fish & Crustaceans
       and other.</p><br>

    <p>A camera button when pushed brings up a framing page that
       captures the animal picture when actioned. Users will need to tag their
       wildlife picture with a generic animal grouping that will have an
       alphabetical suggestion/selection list in the tag field to aid users.
       Upon selection, a more specific identification scroll bar with species
       photos and a more info tab will come up. This identification bar will
       be specific to the area the user is in based on their geolocation from
       GPS data. There will also be an option for ‘not sure’ or ‘cannot
       identify’. Other users will then have the opportunity to help identify
       the photo. A ‘spotted’ button will be used to add the photo to the
       server/database to be included in a nationwide map.</p><br>

    <p>Once registered the
       app allows users to take photos of wildlife in their backyard using the
       camera phone.  The photos are used to identify the animal & the user
       earns a “Card/Sticker” for each animal they collect.  As part of
       gamifying the experience users earn rewards as they collect more animals 
       and can compete against their friends to earn badges.

      <img class="" src="../images/others/badges.png" width="560px"
        alt="picture of wildlife spotter badges" />
    </center>


    <p>Application advertising would be placed on the dashboard interspersed
      between new uploaded contact and on the Australia-wide tagged map as
      members are browsing various parts of the map with options to find out
      more information that links then to direct website and booking sites.  
    </p><br><br>


    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2><br>

    <h3>Wire-frame software</h3>

    <p>The challenge for finding wire-framing software/ tools is an application
      that is available to some or all members of ‘Fully Developed’. There are
      many products on offer for this type of work, but many are paid for
      versions that have short trial periods or restricted access with their
      free offering. Two free options that might be good to work with are
      ‘Justinmind’ and ‘Pencil Project’. Paid versions with workable free
      trials options are ‘Adobe XD’, considered an industry standard, and
      ‘Figma’ is a popular platform also. Brief descriptions are included below.
    </p><br>

      <p><b>Justinmind</b></p>

      <p>This is a free downloadable tool that allows the control over visual
        design elements, web interactions and mobile gestures in the simulated
        prototype. It contains an instant preview feature as you design. The
        viewer allows simulation testing on iphone, ipad and Android devices
        (Justinmind, 2021). You can export the prototype as an interactive HTML
        file. It has pre-installed UI kits for iOS and Android that are
        regularly updated(Webflow, 2021).
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Pencil Project</b></p>

      <p>This is an open source and totally free downloadable application or
        as a firefox extension with support from an active open-source
        community. The extension is an older version that is not actively
        supported (Hufford 2021). It has easy GUI prototyping, built-in shape
        collection, diagram drawing support, inter-page linking and projects
        can be exported in a variety of file formats, such as PDF, PNG, SVG
        and webpage amongst others (Pencil Project, 2021).
      </P><br>

      <p><b>Adobe XD</b></p>

      <p>An Adobe product that works seamlessly with other ‘Creative Cloud’
        products. Comes with a full suite of easy-to-use prototyping tools.
        Requires an Adobe subscription to access full functionality. However,
        it comes in a free version with limitations (Webflow 2021).
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Figma</b></p>

      <p>This is a paid-for web-based design and wireframing app with a
        generous free trial offer that allows for work on up to 3 projects
        with two editors at any one time (Hufford 2021). It doesn’t have
        pre-installed IU kits, but it allows you to upload your own. Design
        elements are easily created in one panel with an uncomplicated
        workflow. The prototypes can be previewed on different mobile screen
        sizes and access individual elements allows export of CSS code
        (Webflow, 2021). The first paid tier is free for students who have a
        valid email address (Hufford 2021). ‘Figma stands out as a powerful
        cloud-based alternative to tools like Sketch and XD’
        (Myre, 2021, para. 1).
      </p><br>

      <h3>Graphic design software</h3><br>

      <p><b>Adobe Photoshop</b></p>

      <p>Adobe photoshop is the industry leading image manipulation software.
        Adobe photoshop could be useful in our project for creating “mock-ups
        for the front end of our website or app” (Edelmayer, 2019). This would
        enable us to have a clear idea of the layout of our website or app and
        get agreement from everybody on exactly what we are building. Another
        potential Adobe tool that could be useful is Adobe Dreamweaver, even
        if not using Dreamweaver's webpage generation functionality this could
        also be a useful tool for rapid prototyping of layout and content of
        the site.
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Adobe Illustrator</b></p>

      <p>Adobe Illustrator is a useful tool for “high precision designs”
        (Adobe, n.d.), it allows for the creation of “vector graphics” (Adobe
        Illustrator, n.d.) which allows for scalability and greater control
        over the graphics that have been created for the website and app.
        Adobe Illustrator also has typography tools that could help us in the
        creation of an aesthetically pleasing website. This tool would also
        allow us to have “faster file opening, improved effects, simplified
        vector paths and freeform gradients” (Adobe Illustrator, n.d.) and
        this would allow for better control over the user interface (UI) and
        user experience (UX) of our website and app.
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Gimp</b></p>

      <p>Gimp is compatible across many platforms including GNU/Linux, OS X,
        Windows and more. It is a free, open-source image editor GIMP has
        customizable options as well as 3rd party plugins. Not only does it
        allow for “high quality photo manipulation” (Gimp, n.d.) but it also
        allows for original artwork creation. The graphic design elements
        would be particularly useful for our project as it could allow us to
        create things such as “icons, graphical design elements and art for
        user interface (UI) components and mock-ups” (Gimp, n.d.). This would
        be useful as it would enhance the visual elements of our webpage and
        app.
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Canva</b></p>

      <p>Canva is a graphic design platform that could allow us to create
        visual design elements for our webpage and app with the platform allow
        us to create logos, templates and charts. Canva also has photo editing
        features, palette generating features and font combinations to help
        with styling a webpage or app (Canva, n.d.).
      </p><br>

      <h3>Presentation Software</h3><br>

      <p><b>Adobe Premier Pro</b></p>
      <p>Adobe Premier Pro is a timeline-based video editor originally launched
        in 2003 and is geared towards professional video editors. It supports
        high resolution video editing as well as professional level tools for
        audio. It supports Windows and Mac and costs $20.99 a month or $239.88
        annually.
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Davinci Resolve</b></p>
      <p>Davinci resolve is free allowing you use the program in almost its
        entirety but puts some things behind a pay wall, these features are
        however much higher end for instance the free version allows you to
        export media at 4K resolution while the paid version allows up to 32K
        resolution. Another thing is performance, while the free version allows
        some GPU acceleration when plaything things back rendering is still
        done 	on the CPU while paying for it allows full utilization of the
        GPUs allowing for rendering to also be done through it instead of the
        CPU. Overall, the version in which you pay for isn’t a necessity and
        the free version would work fantastically without paying a cent.
      </p><br>

      <p><b>iMovie</b></p>
      <p>iMovie is a free editor that is only available inside the apple
        ecosystem 	     allowing it to be used on the iMac, iPhone and iPad.
        With iMovie you 	can create professional looking videos without an
        editing degree. Easily add photos and videos to your projects, trim
        clips with your finger and add seamless transitions and fade audio
        like a pro” (Apple, 2021).
      </p><br>

      <p><b>Openshot Video Editor</b></p>

      <p>This is a completely free open-source project that has cross-platform
        functionality (Linux, Mac and Windows) and supports a 	variety of
        video and audio file formats. It allows for use of unlimited tracks
        and layers, with a range of video effects, such as 	transitions, speed
        changes and frame accuracy editing, plus other, along audio mixing and
        editing features (Openshot, 2021).
      </p><br>

      <h3>Client-Side Technologies</h3><br>

        <p><b>Angular, React and Vue</b></p>
        <p>Front-End Languages we could use are Angular, React and Vue which
          are JavaScript single application frameworks (Huspi, 2019). This
          would be useful because it would allow us to make use of Apache
          Cordova or similar frameworks to produce mobile applications across
          both Android and iPhone, as well as a web application if desired.
          Thus, eliminating the issue of needing to develop the same
          application multiple times. (Cordova, n.d.). Apache Cordova also
          makes it easier to use common web-technologies such as JavaScript
          and HTML (Cordova, n.d.).
        </p><br>

        <h3>Project Management Tools (Kanban Boards, Version Control, Issue tracker)</h3><br>

        <p>Project management tools including an issue tracker which could
          allow us to keep track of identifying and resolving any issues in
          the “life cycle of the project” (Mind Tools, n.d.).
        </p><br>

        <ul>
          <li>Kanban boards for easy visual tracking of issue status and
            “workflow progress” (Thinking Portfolio, 2018). This would help
            our group to stay organised throughout the project.
          </li><br>

          <li>A version control system such as Git, Microsoft TFS, Subversion
            (SVN) could allow us to backup work, collaborate as a team on a
            project and manage any conflicts that may arise in the code
            (Version Control Systems, 2020).
          </li><br>

          <li>Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD)
            pipelines could be used for automated deployment, for merges as
            well as testing and setting up databases and any other repetitive
            tasks that needs to be performed (Katalon, 2019).
          </li><br><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Local Development Environments and Development Servers</h3><br>

        <p>Local development environments such as VS Code, Atom as well as
          Development Servers such as Xampp or npm server packages would allow
          us to check our work locally while we are developing, and it could
          allow us to test what we are creating. Having a development
          environment is important as it could allow us to deploy the
          final project with minimal bugs and would allow our team to reach
          our goals for the project on time (Holland, 2017).
        </p><br>

        <h3>Data Base Software Platforms</h3><br>

        <p>MySQL, Google Firebase, AWS Dynamo DB. Having these database
          software platforms allows us to store data securely.
        </p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>MySQL has features such as data recovery support and the ability
          to create customisable web sites and applications (Daniel, H 2010).
          </li>
          <li>Google Firebase for example would provide things such as fast and
          safe hosting, reliable and extensive databases, Google Analytics and
          authentication services (Back4App, n.d.).
          </li>
          <li>AWS Dynamo DB is a cloud-based platform, and it would allow us to
          “store, process, and access data” to support our application
          development. (Rathod, A 2018
          </li>
      </ul><br>

      <h3>Server-Side Technologies</h3><br>

      <p><b>Visual Recognition Software</b></p>
      <p>The software listed below would enable our group to easily make use
        of image recognition and machine learning software without developing
        it ourselves from scratch all we would need to do is call the end
        points associated with that service using our own back-end service
        such as AWS Lambda or something similar.
      </p><br>

      <ul>
        <li>AWS- Amazon Rekognition which has in built image recognition as a
          service. All that is needed is to provide an image or video to the
          Amazon Rekognition API, and the service can identity objects for you
          (AWS Developers Guide, n.d.).
        </li>
        <li>Azure Computer Vision (Azure Cognitive Services) enables “visual
          data processing” to identify images, content, objects and concepts
          and no machine learning expertise is needed (Computer Vision, n.d.).
        </li>
        <li>Vision AI Google Service identifies objects automatically and it
          can classify images (Google Cloud, n.d.).
        </li>
      </ul><br><br>

      <h3>Back-End Languages (Python, Node.js)</h3><br>
      <p>Back-End Languages- Python, or Node.js (The advantage of these
        languages is that they are the most compatible with serverless or
        microservices, or a microservices based technology.) The benefit of
        using serverless compatible languages is that it could allow for
        quicker deployments and updates, decreased latency, greater
        scalability, lower development costs (Cloudflare, n.d.).The major
        cloud vendors such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure
        functions all have some level of Python support and are examples of
        microservices based architecture. (Full Stack Phyton, n.d.)
      </p><br>

      <h3>Security Features</h3><br>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTPS for encrypted connections to enhance security, when using
          HTTPS no one can “eavesdrop” on sensitive information (Hoffman, C 2018).
        </li>
        <li>MFA Authentication which requires two or more proofs of identity
          before granting access. Two-factor authentication can be used which
          is the most common type of MFA. (Australian Government Cyber
          Security, n.d.).
        </li>
        <li>JSON web tokens, JSON web tokens could be used to encrypt messages
          and code used for authentication. JSON web tokens are a safe way “of
          transferring claims between two parties” (Business Education, 2021).
        </li>
      </ul><br>

    <h3>Skills Required</h3><br>

    <ul>
      <li>Graphic design skills for creating the user avatars, emoji, design layouts.</li>
      <li>Using wireframing skills to map the logical path and operation of the application.</li>
      <li>Mobile app development skills to create samples of what certain parts of the application will look like.</li>
      <li>Database and form handling skills to create sample user profiles.</li>
      <li>Presentation skills to put together a pitch for funding to move to the development and deployment stage of the project.</li>
      <li>Security features skills to ensure the transfer client data is encrypted and secure from attempted breaches.</li>
      <li>Client-side technology skills with user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) considerations a major focus.</li>
      <li>Project management skills to plan and manage workflow in a logical sequence for efficiency and productivity.</li>
      <li>Serve-side technology integration skills to help support the UX with functionality.</li>
      <li>Back-end language skills to support the server-side task operability.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h3>Outcome</h3><br>
    <p><b>What will be the outcome?</b></p>
    <p>The outcome will be phone app that works across both Apple and
      Android devices. It will be free to download from the respective
      app stores and will include advertising and sponsorship content
      that will make the application commercially viable. The application
      will be a way for users to get in touch with their natural
      environment and be more willing to explore what lives in them. The
      application will foster a community of like-minded people, with the
      ability to share and learn from others. Users will then be motivated
      and aided to plan and book their next wildlife adventure to explore
      the wonders of this great country.
    </p><br>
    <p><b>How will the original problem be solved?</b></p>
    <p>This application will promote greater awareness of Australia’s
      unique wildlife and the environments that they live in, as well
      as the pressures they are facing from human induced climate change
      and development. It will be an active way that users can become
      responsible tourists and help in the collection of data about
      wildlife, Australia wide. It will provide a strong platform to
      promote tourism and more specifically eco-tourism to people coming
      out of severe lockdowns and restrictions in most cases, from the
      pandemic.
    </p><br>
    <p><b>What impact will this development have?</b></p>
    <p>This application would allow users to interact with wildlife,
      helping them to understand their natural environment better, as
      well as a resource for learning and a way to contribute to
      environmental monitoring. It will provide resources for people who
      have found injured wildlife, which would help in the greater success
      of recovery for those animals. It would promote Australian tourism
      in a more engaging way, and it could be scaled up to become a world
      wildlife explorer’s application.
