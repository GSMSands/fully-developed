    <h1>Interview with Shannon Sands</h1><br><br>
    <h2>Front-End Developer at Swissport</h2><br><br>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannon-sands-73526136/">Shannon's linkedin profile</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>It’s Sunday afternoon, and Shannon should be enjoying time with his family but has instead rushed
      them back from an outing so he can jump on a video call with Sam and me for this interview.  As diligent
      students, we had been on the call for 20 minutes before the allotted start time, talking through some
      last-minute refinement of our questions, eager to be ready when Shannon dialled in.  We jump to attention
       when right-on-time we see the familiar “Shannon Sands waiting in lobby” message pop onto the screen and
       dutifully click the admit button ready to start the conversation, but alas, nothing happens.  For the
       next 10 minutes, what ensues is an all too familiar frantic plethora of messages back and forth, until
       finally, following a last-minute computer swap, Shannon appears on our screen, looking every bit the
       calm consummate IT professional that he is.  We joke about how good technology is when it works while
       I try to find the record button. </p>
      <br />
    <p>This feels like a comfortable place for Shannon, solving problems on the fly, and looking at his resume,
      I can see why. Shannon has over 10 years of experience working in the IT industry, starting out in Customer
       Service and IT help desk roles then graduating to Developer roles after completing his Bachelor of
       Information (Computing Studies), Software Engineering with RMIT in 2016. </p>
      <br />
    <p>For the past year, Shannon has been in the role of Senior Front-End Developer and team leader with
      Swissport, based in Brisbane. If the name Swissport rings a bell for you, it could be that you’ve seen
      it in an airport.  Swissport operates in 315 airports in 50 countries around the world, employing 68,000
      team members to provide ground services and cargo handling for the aviation industry.</p>
      <br />
    <p>We start by asking how IT works in the aviation industry and how much IT is involved in the business.
      Shannon nods knowingly as he tells us IT is heavily involved these days and incredibly complex with all
      the baggage and infrastructure that needs to be tracked.  Fun fact in 2020, Swissport handled 4.1 million
      tons of cargo (Swissport 2021), that’s the equivalent of 205 million 20kg suitcases.  On top of all that
       cargo is the scheduling and staff requirements; Shannon tells us that at any given time, they have 10’s
       of thousands of frontline workers tending to tasks in airports and keeping all that coordinated is a
       pretty big challenge.</p>
       <br />
      <p>I recently had the opportunity to tour the Virgin Australia head office in Brisbane and was stunned
        by the level of to-the-minute detail their services were scheduled to.  Reflecting on this as I
        listened, I asked Shannon what the impact of baggage handlers being late to a plane would be.  My
        question is met with a polite but almost dismissive hmm, that I immediately understood as that would
        never happen!  Shannon then gave us our first glimpse of the IT complexity involved “even little
        things you wouldn’t even think of, like stocking the liquor cabinets.  We’ve got a whole system just
        to make sure the drinks are there on time because a plane can’t leave unless there is coke in the
        refrigerator!  The whole thing is a really detailed exercise in logistics and coordination.” </p>
        <br />
      <p>Eager to learn more about how this happens, Sam asks Shannon what his role as a Front-End developer
        involves.  Shannon shares that while his title is Front-End Developer, his job is more of a Full-Stack
        developer. I took a note to research what the difference was later and have since learned: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Front-End developers focus on the client-facing side of software, the parts the end users
              see and interact with. </li>

            <li>Back-end developers focus on the code, databases, libraries, and system components that the
              end-users don’t see.</li>

            <li>Full-Stack developers “can best be explained as the “jack of all trades”.  They are skilled
              in both front-end and back-end languages and can work with multiple frameworks” (Duggal 2020)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When doing Front-End work, Shannon is using Angular, an open-source development software, telling
          us “it’s still extremely popular in enterprise because it’s really tightly integrated with
          Microsoft.net Core…because of that, a lot of enterprises trust it and rely on it pretty heavily”. </p>
        <br />
        <p>It becomes evident during the discussion that a big part of the Front-End role Shannon has is
          the interpretation of work. When a stakeholder proposes a seemingly innocent project to “Make a
          form”, Shannon then has to do a detailed interrogation to find all the necessary information to
          build the form. Details like fonts, button location and what happens to the data once the user has
          entered it into the form are all vital to the success of the project. Shannon says, “interpreting
          the business requirements and ensuring we have the correct solution” is the most challenging part
          of his role. </p>
          <br />
        <p>Graphic design is another key element for the Front-End developer.  Shannon shares that they have
          a particularly talented Front-End specialist who excels at making things look good. “There is all
          sorts of little details you wouldn’t think of, the subtle animations as you change pages, so it’s
          not all clunky or even how you actually lay out the design of the page, so it draws people’s
          attention”.</p>
          <br />
        <p>There is a strong focus for Front-End developers on the User Experience (UX) “Because there is
          always people that say “I can’t find the button”, so we say it’s the giant red button flashing
          in the middle of the page”. </p>
          <br />
        <p>We move on to talking about the Back-End development and learn that most applications are CRUD
          apps – designed to Create, Read, Update or Delete data. Shannon says for a Back-End Developer, the
          devil is in the detail though, “every single organisation has a lot of differing business rules,
          with a lot of different automation that happens along the way… This person has filled out the form
          on the Front-End; now what happens? Do we just save it to the database, do we send an email
          notification to a salesperson, do we schedule that salespersons calendar to go and contact the
          person.  There is all sorts of little bits of complexity that come between the Front-End and the
          database.” </p>
          <br />
        <p>The technology Swissport are using is primarily Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microservices.
          The Microservices work like a chain of Lego blocks that allow them to build the overall system
          without a single point of failure.  The magic for a Back-End developer is understanding how all
          the services and infrastructure communicate and maintaining the network.  As I start to ponder the
          sheer volume of devices and services they would have to look after, Shannon gives us an example,
          “The busses that take you out to the plane at the airport each have an iPad; there are thousands
          of them, they control the schedule for the bus and the announcements made on the bus – each of the
          devices need to have regular updates pushed to them.”</p>
          <br />
        <p>Shannon explains how each plane also has a sensor that provides different information; combined
          with all the other sensors and devices, he concludes there may be 100’s of 1000’s of sensors and
          devices contributing data to the system. I marvel at what it takes to get a plane in the air, and
          Shannon reiterates the importance of making it all come together. “It has to be carefully
          coordinated; you don’t want to cause a traffic jam and have a situation where people can’t fly for
          a day”. </p>
          <br />
        <p>We ask Shannon about his workload and what other tasks he has to do.  Full-stack development
          takes up 60-70% of his time; the other 30-40% is planning & coordination with other people in his
          own and other teams.  Communication skills are identified as the top generic skills required for
          IT professionals (Burning Glass Technologies 2018), so it comes as no surprise to hear that
          communication is a huge part of what he does. Shannon says, “IT guys are generally not just in the
          basement anymore” there is lots of meetings and catchups to attend”.</p>
          <br />
        <p>One of his key tasks includes providing demonstrations to the business; this allows them to get
          feedback on the product in development and make changes as required.  Communication & troubleshooting
          skills are paramount when they encounter problems in the development process, something doesn’t work
          as designed, or what the customer is asking for is not feasible.  Shannon and his team then have
          to work with each other and the wider business to find the best solution. </p>
          <br />
        <p>Shannon spends most of his time working with the other developers on his team, especially the
          lead developer, but also works with the General Manager in charge of IT.  There are also a number
          of stakeholders across Swissport that he works with depending on the project. These include
          station managers, different project managers and “if we are lucky” a Business Analyst.  “Business
          analysts help guide businesses in improving processes, products, services and software through
          data analysis. These agile workers straddle the line between IT and the business to help bridge
          the gap and improve efficiency.” (Pratt & White 2019)</p>

          <br>
        <p>Occasionally Shannon also gets to interact with end-users when a new product goes live but
          admits this “is only if I’m unlucky” as it’s usually a job handled by the helpdesk or tech
          support crew. </p>
          <br />
        <p>We discuss where the project ideas come from; I’m intrigued to learn that the vast majority of the
          idea generation comes from the business; however, Shannon and his team have plenty of input into how
          the product/project will be developed. For example, his team made the decision to use the
          Microservices back-end and Angular Front-End architecture currently deployed at Swissport, but
          Shannon says, “we probably could have sold them on a… Docker Swarm Back-End and React Front-End”
          solution</p>
          <br />
        <p>And whilst they aren’t proposing project ideas, his team are still conscious of future
          opportunities; he knows that given the volume of data Swissport are handling, it’s likely they
          will want to do something with machine learning applications in the future.  They are checking
          in with the team to see if anyone already has expertise in the area in order to meet the need
          when the business asks. </p>
          <br />
        <p>For Shannon bringing all of the ideas and solutions together, especially figuring out the
          challenging tasks, makes it all worthwhile. </p>
          <br />
        <p>Our half an hour with Shannon has flown by, and we close out the interview asking for advice
          on how to follow in his footsteps.  Shannon's advice is simple: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get some experience, work on your own projects while you are at university – keep an
              active GitHub to demonstrate your work.  Find open-source projects to contribute to, so
              there is visible public works that you can reference.</li>

            <li>Have really good knowledge of all the different technologies in the industry. GitHub,
              Microsoft teams and project management tools like JIRA “I underestimated how important all
              of the different tools and technologies around programming were versus just knowing the
              languages themselves”</li>

            <li>It’s not all about hacking code!  “People get hung up on which is the best programming
              language, but the more experience you get, you realise that just doesn’t matter”. </li>

            <li>Communication and Soft skills are just as important “there is more to it than just
              sitting in a basement”.  </li>
        </ul>
