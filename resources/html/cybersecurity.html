    <h1>Cybersecurity</h1><br><br>
    <p>Cybersecurity is comprised of practices, processes, and technologies to
      assist in protecting systems, networks, and data from malicious intent and
      unauthorised access (De Groot 2020).</p></br><br>
    <p>The current state of cybersecurity in Australia reportedly paints a damning
      picture. During the 2020-21 financial year, the Australian Cyber Security
      Centre (ACSC) reported that there were over 67,500 cybercrime incidents
      which have increased by 13% from the previous year (Australian Signals
      Directorate (ASD) et al. 2021). Furthermore, government organisations
      are not immune to cyber-attacks, as, in July of 2021, the New South Wales’s
      Department of Education fell victim to a malevolent cybersecurity incident.
      Systems were disrupted and taken offline just as students and teachers took
      their learning online due to the Covid-19 lockdown (Tan 2021). As technological
      advancements continue to make headway, so do the cyber security incidences.
      According to Veerasamy (2020), cybercrime usually takes place for monetary gain,
      while malicious individuals and groups carry out hacking and other cyber-exploitation
      for excitement and ‘clout’, which by modern definitions is to boost one’s
      ego.</p><br><br>

          Cybercrime Damage by 2021 (Chang 2021)<br>(This infographic depicts a grim
          future that cybercrime has penetrated everyday life and continues to
          cause significant economic losses)</i></p>
    </center><br><br>
    <p>In the public sector, the Australian Government is actively providing resources
      for increasing cyber security awareness (DIIS, 2018). Additionally, concerning
      businesses and larger corporations, routine employee training aimed at
      cybersecurity topics and regular revision of Information Technology (IT)
      procedures and policy needs to take place (Tellier 2018). Cybersecurity for
      government organisations can be improved through extensive multi-layer use of
      user-friendly authentication solutions, biometric security measures like
      fingerprint sensors and face-recognition software, and notably, by having a
      prudent plan that addresses authentication (Chertoff & Grant 2017).</p><br><br>
    <p>Through incidents such as the Sony and, more recently, Facebook hack, it has
      been proven that passwords alone are not adequate. Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) will be commonplace in cloud services and web applications (Walker 2020).
      In larger organisations, mass digital transformation has begun to take place
      as Covid-19 acted as the catalyst in driving the need for remote work.
      Companies and Governments will review and improve their IT processes and
      procedures through better education and adopting newer security technologies
      (Brooks 2021).</p><br><br>
    <p>Several notable technologies make cybersecurity implementation possible.
      Firstly, through Blockchain, a technology mainly used for cryptocurrency,
      government agencies such as the National Health Service (NHS) of England
      have begun to use this technology to encrypt and secure data (Sturman 2020).
      Secondly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is more adept at detecting
      cyber-attacks and data breaches using refined algorithms. Through machine
      learning, systems are trained to spot malware and ransomware and run pattern
      recognition before they occur (Belani 2021). Thirdly, Multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) uses a combination of elements to authenticate (Walker 2020).</p><br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><i><b>Knowledge</b></i></p>Personal information, including maiden names,
        phone numbers and pet names.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i><b>Possession</b></i></p>One-time password (OTP) generating tokens or
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i><b>Inherence</b></i></p>Metrics intrinsically owned by the authorised user
        in the form of fingerprints and voice recognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i><b>Location-based</b></i></p>Using the user's IP address to determine location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i><b>Risk-based</b></i></p>By analysing the user’s behaviour, for example,
        the time the access is requested, whether the user is using a private
        or public network and the consistency in devices being used.
      </li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p>As these cybersecurity technologies continue to develop rapidly, the threats
      and cyber-attacks will become more sophisticated. There are escalating concerns
      that these technologies will worsen the inequality between the technology-versed
      and the technology-illiterate. However, with the implementation of technologies
      such as Blockchain, AI and MFA, alongside adequate education and cyber-awareness,
      building a cyber-resilient society is possible (Kavanagh 2019).</p><br><br>
    <p>It is possible that the increase in cybersecurity breaches is greater than
      ordinary citizens can fathom. In Australia, a new government bill was introduced
      in August 2021 to give the police more power to spy on cybercriminal suspects
      online. Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, stated
      that the bill’s powers ‘are unprecedented and extraordinarily intrusive; they
      should be narrowed to strictly necessary and subject to robust safeguards’
      (Karp 2021).</p><br><br>
    <p>In 2004, The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)
      was in effect to focus on unifying laws and expanding alliances across
      countries so that all sorts of cybercriminal activity such as denial of
      service (DDoS) attacks, malware, or online scams could be prosecuted in the
      affected countries (Daskal & Kennedy-Mayo 2020). While this treaty is considered
      to be exhaustive in dealing with cybercrime, it has been condemned for not
      protecting human rights adequately (Brown 2021). Therefore, as cybercrimes
      and cybersecurity breaches continue to increase at an alarming rate, there
      could be less privacy and rights for everyone.</p><br><br>
    <p>In countries like China and Russia, governments have effectively been granted
      ‘cyber sovereignty due to their rampant cybercrime occurrences. Practices
      considered objectionable to other democracies, like extreme online censorship
      and control of internet gateways, are used to monitor their citizens. Other
      technologies such as facial recognition technologies and data mining are
      also used to spy on potential cybercriminals (Sherman 2019).</p><br><br>
    <p>Mass digital transformation for for-profit organisations and not-for-profit
      organisations will take place. With many now working from home or attending
      school and universities online, it is inevitable that the threat of cybersecurity
      breaches will escalate. This will lead to the Government stepping in to protect
      their citizens, potentially granting them too much power in monitoring and
      eroding human rights (Mulaomerovic 2021).</p><br><br>
    <p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, careers in cybersecurity are
      tipped to grow by 31 per cent by 2029 (Paykamian 2021). Burning Glass
      Technologies (2020) reported that as global cybersecurity face new challenges
      at an exponential rate, new skills will be required in combatting them.
      In areas such as application development security and cloud security, the
      high demand will come with significant salary premiums. Occupations such
      as software developers, systems engineers and network architects will be
      required to possess these skills. To follow suit, the demand for cybersecurity
      or IT-related education will increase. Institutions and organisations will
      devote more resources to cybersecurity programs and training (Paykamian 2021).</p><br><br>
    <p>Regarding technologies, single password authentication will be made redundant
      as MFA technologies are developed further. With cloud storage technology
      deemed more secure than local storage, consumer hardware for data storage
      will also see a decrease (Weaver 2021). Additionally, new technologies will
      need to be put in place. For example, at International Business Machines
      Corporation (IBM), cybersecurity-related services such as Security as a
      Service (SaaS) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) are available for
      businesses. Newer technologies are constantly being developed as part of
      their offerings (Jha 2021).</p><br><br>
    <p>Cybersecurity anxiety is on the rise in the modern world. According to Dr
      Maria Bada (2020), “The psychological effects of cyber-attacks may even
      rival those of traditional terrorism.” It is unavoidable that the increase
      in cybersecurity breaches is taking a psychological toll on the general
      population (Guynn 2020).</p><br><br>
    <p>Personally, there is a change in purchasing habits to favour technology products
      such as phones with better Security and e-commerce websites with better
      authentication. Additionally, access to personal data, including online
      banking services, government websites and even social media, may be restricted
      due to MFA technologies. However, on a positive note, cybersecurity-related
      professions are in demand, and as a student in IT, this is good news.</p><br><br>
    <center><img src="../images/cybersecurity/top-cybersecurity-concerns.gif" alt="Figure 3: Top Cybersecurity Concerns"
        width="560px"><br><br>
      <p><i><b>Figure 3</b>: Top Cybersecurity Concerns (Stouffer 2021)<br>(This infographic
          highlights the top cybersecurity concerns by the general public. Observed
          is a 78 percentage of consumers who are concerned about data privacy,
          followed by 63 per cent who are very worried that their identity will be
          stolen and 58 per cent who are worried about being a victim of cybercrime.
          This data informs us that an above average number of people are concerned
          about the state of cybersecurity)</p></i>
    </center><br><br>
    <p>As the gap of cybersecurity knowledge grows, the uneducated will become easy
      targets for cybercriminals. This will require the governments to step in to
      try and protect their citizens by educating and sending warnings. Data
      breaches will also become common with the increased consumption of social
      media by children (Rachwani 2021). As a parent of a young child, measures
      are taken at home to secure data privacy during the usage of devices such
      as iPads and mobile phones, albeit being restrictive in nature. As a
      daughter to elderly parents, a wider gap of knowledge is observed as the
      older generation are less aware of the state of cybersecurity and are more
      likely to be affected. In turn, the level of anxiety increases as cyber
      criminals become more innovative in their illegal activities.</p><br><br>
    <p>In conclusion, developing cybersecurity technology is a response to a
      cybercrime pandemic. Much like the Covid-19 virus and its vaccine, if
      this technology is undermined, the losses may not be known right away but
      will be destructive when it surfaces. Our addiction to data consumption
      will likely continue at an exponential rate, and it is imperative that
      cybersecurity be considered at every level.</p><br><br>
