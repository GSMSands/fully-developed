        <p>Looking at a data from the tests in Assignment 1, this show similarities
        between all 5 of us. Overall, most of us are INFJ and are all skewed
        towards introverted, some more than others. My results show that as a
        team member I very much work within my feelings as well as being quite
        introverted. However, I have high emotional stability. I have a turbulent
        personality which means I’m success-driven, a perfectionist and eager to improve.
        <br><br>
        In a group situation, diplomat advocates are sensitive to criticism;
        meaning, we become defensive in the face of criticism. Also, we can be
        reluctant to open up which means, while we value honesty we are also very
        private and have a hard time opening up. We are also more vulnerable
        about our struggles. Diplomat advocates are prone to burn out.
        <br><br>
        Potential conflicts could arise due to our sensitivity with criticism
        and may lead to conflict between group members. Our reluctance to openness
        could be a huge issue due to not getting the assistance we need when we
        need it due to our desire to not be vulnerable in front of people.</p>

        <p>Looking at the data and results of all three personality quizzes from
          Assessment 1, similarities between the results across the quizzes can
          be seen. Overall, the results skew towards introversion and assertiveness,
          thinking over feeling and conscientiousness. These results in the context
          of group work show that as a team member I bring, an independent and
          analytical approach to the team, as well as a desire to research areas
          deeply and take initiative to complete tasks.<br><br>
          When reading further about the Myers-Briggs learning styles I found
          that the introverted types prefer “deep concentration on finding problems
          and solutions” (Khamparia & Pandey, 2017), whereas extroverted types
          “are action-oriented individuals who would like to interact with others
          and society” (Khamparia & Pandey, 2017). Within a group work context frustration could arise in regards to how to start and work through a task. With the INTJ personality type being prone to thinking their solutions are the best way forward, it would be beneficial for me to take pause before engaging in a discussion and to keep in mind that there are many ways to complete a task. Keeping an open mind to how others complete tasks and the processes that they use to do that may enable me to learn a new way of doing things.<br><br>
          When it comes to completing tasks INTJ favour the Judging aspect over
          the Perceiving aspect. Judging learners “are swift and action oriented”
          whereas Perceptive learners “are curious and interested in learning
          new details and findings about each task (Khamparia & Pandey, 2017).
          An issue that may arise with this is that when completing tasks, I may
          try to take a very proactive approach to completing work, if I am then
          in a group with others who lean towards being perceptive learners, I
          will need to learn how to take a slightly different pace and understand
          that whilst I might want to jump into the work right away there is also
          value in taking time to gather resources and materials before jumping
          into a task.<br><br>
          A lot of the possible conflicts that could arise in a group work scenario
          can be mitigated by an open and conscientious approach. Understanding
          that differences in personality and learning styles are not a bad thing,
          but are simply another way of reaching the same end goal. Keeping lines
          of communication open and clear if issues should arise is valuable
          especially as we are not having a group experience in person.</p><br>

          <p>Evaluating the results of these three personality tests, I can conclude
            that my personality leans towards introversion while also highly intuitive
            and preferring order and stability over spontaneity. I can also observe
            that the data from two of the tests, MBTI and Big 5 Factor suggest that
            my agreeableness and constant need to improve may conflict each other and have the potential to cause burnout due to an internal struggle between the need to please and the need to challenge. It is also suggested that to achieve my goals, concrete steps are often conceived and taken. In terms of preferred learning styles, the results indicated that the pragmatist and theorist style stood out the most. This means that I prefer to learn from tangible facts and case studies using real-life statistics and systems.<br><br>
            In a group context, these results suggest that I am most effective
            around others who possess the same goals. As I am highly introverted,
            extra effort will be needed to communicate effectively. My eagerness
            to please may also contribute to a phenomenon aptly named “Groupthink”
            which is when a group born of good intentions make decisions that are
            poorly thought out due to an overemphasis in preserving harmony and
            unity over critical thinking. However, there are ways to circumvent
            this by discussing goals and protocols at the beginning of the project.
            Critical thinking, discord and challenges should also be supported to
            obtain the best course of action (Cherry 2020).<br><br>
            Potential conflicts that arise could be caused by imbalanced workload,
            skills, and principles. Personally, as my Big 5 Factor suggests of my
            conscientiousness, I am careful and diligent when broaching tough topics.
            The test results also indicate a high degree of openness to experience
            which is a positive trait when navigating difficult group situations as it
            suggests resiliency and divergent thinking.</p><br>

            <p>Reviewing the team’s profile results, it would be easy for me to
              get lost in the sea of data, but I am reminded these are merely
              tools to start conversations. Here are three examples of, in my case,
              hastily completed, 5 min online surveys that are somehow meant to
              unlock a magic window into the complexities of the human personality.
              We then pour over the results and draw correlations with our daily behaviour.
              As our tutor, Thomas Bierly, has pointed out, the Learning Styles
              framework has been proven to be based on falsified data and negatively
              affect students who choose to rely upon it (Newton & Salvi 2020).
              <br><br>
              The Myers-Briggs® data, while more robust in its research, is still
              only useful in the context it was designed for, which is “to be
              descriptive, not predictive.” (The Myers and Briggs Foundation n.d.)
              <br><br>
              With that in mind, my observations are that the team overwhelmingly
              has a tendency for the diplomat role, we will need to be careful
              when making decisions as we could easily fall into the trap of discussing
              things at length without actually setting outcomes or making decisions.
              <br><br>
              Most of our Myers-Briggs® profile scores fall within the middle 3rd
              of the range (between 50 & 80%), effectively sitting on the fence
              between one extreme and the other. This could allow the team to
              display behaviour flexibility by stretching out of the comfort zone
              when required, eg one team member stepping up to be more assertive
              and chairing the team meeting.<br><br>
              As a team we will need to remember that no matter what the profile
              results say, all of the team members have strengths and use these
              to the best of our ability to complete the task at hand. Clear communication
              and objectives will be the key to success for the team.</p><br>

              <p>Comparing the data from the 3 tests that our five group members
                took, it is clear to see that there are similarities between us
                at first glance. The ‘Learning Styles’ and the ‘Big 5’ tests are
                difficult to interpret as percentages set against brief criteria
                are prone to differing interpretations. The Myer-Briggs test offers
                a more detailed interpretation that is applied to a variety of
                situations, as well as highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of
                the result category one is placed in.<br><br>
                The negative stand outs for me in the Big 5 in comparison to the
                other team members are the extroversion and the emotional stability
                being on the lower end of the scale. This has me described as more
                of a ‘shut in’ personality with the potential to become quite stressed
                in demanding situations, which may just mean I need time to settle
                into a group dynamic before putting in my personal opinions, which
                could make for a slow start with like personalities. To manage my
                personal stress, I will need to ask clarifying questions often so
                I can see and plan the path forward, which will be of benefit for
                the whole group. On the positive, my other results lend themselves
                to making a reliable group member scoring high in agreeableness,
                conscientiousness and intellect/imagination, which confirms my need
                to get along with others at all costs (Open-Source Psychometrics Project, 2019).

                Having retaken the learning styles test to align with the other
                group members for consistency and a fair comparison, it highlights
                my hands on approach to tasks with ‘kinaesthetic’ in the old test
                and ‘pragmatist’ in the new test rating the highest. Where problems
                arise and a solution needs to be devised, I am in my element, yet
                with theoretical work that requires lots of reading and research I
                may struggle somewhat and may require group input to keep me motivated
                (Emtrain, n.d).<br><br>
                The Myer-Briggs test results were more informative, although a
                little pigeon-hole like with their categories. To summarise my results,
                I was identified as a ‘Assertive Advocate’ type who is best in a
                ‘Diplomatic’ role and works best with a ‘Confident Individualism’
                strategy. From what I could gather this is somewhat a rare combination.
                An Assertive Advocate demonstrates confidence in expressing their ideas,
                but also understated at times preferring to keep the piece instead of
                challenging others, as well as aim to do what is right. We feel compelled
                to use our creativity, imagination and sensitivity. We come across as
                reserved, however we communicate in a warm and sensitive way, with the
                need to help others, although we need time to work by ourselves to get
                tasks completed. Scanning the strengths and weakness for this category,
                the areas of being ‘creative, insightful, passionate and altruistic’,
                as strengths, resonate with me and can add support and depth to the
                group in tackling problems. The weaknesses of ‘sensitivity to criticism,
                reluctance to open up and prone to burn out’ will be areas that I will
                need to monitor and take a reality check once-in-a-while to keep things
                in perspective, as a group member (16 Personalities, n.d.)<br><br>
                Reflecting on my role as a group member from the test results returned,
                it is clear to say that being involved in many aspects of the assignment
                will be important for my sense of contribution, along with the supporting
                and helping of others towards a common goal. My creativity and imagination
                will need to be engaged for a stake in the task, paired with a need for
                comfort in group cohesion and harmony. Clarity of purpose to manage
                time and tasks is something I will need to highlight to minimise burnout
                and be assertive in putting forward ideas, along with acceptance
                of criticism as a natural part of working in a group situation.
