    <h1>Tools</h1><br>
    <p>The collaboration tools we used include GitHub, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft
      Office Suite and Canvas. The true state of group efforts was reflected most
      in Microsoft Teams, as collaboration was mostly done on this platform.
      As the submission is a PDF file, the team felt that this was the best platform.</p>
      <br>

    <!--Microsoft Teams Begin-->
    <h2>Microsoft Teams</h2><br>
    <p><b>Channels we have created and their purposes:</b></p><br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>General</b> -This channel was the most used to discuss initial
        decisions and for other project items not covered by the other channels
        listed below. The ‘A2 Tasks’ tab within it contained the team’s Kanban board.
        The ‘Files’ tab contained all sorts of uncategorized documents within it.</li>
      <li><b>-Off Topic</b> - This channel was created as a forum for funny and
        off-topic things we find on the internet or in our daily lives. This was
        created to simulate a break room as we are physically limited.</li>
      <li><b>A2 Final Assessment</b> - This channel’s purpose served the discussion
        of all final document items produced for the group project. The ‘Files’
        tab within it contains working documents and final documents.</li>
      <li><b>A2 Interview with IT Professional</b> - This channel was used to
        discuss and organize interviews with IT professional for the purpose of
        writing the essay. The ‘Files’ tab within it contains draft documents,
        final documents and interview recordings.</li>
      <li><b>A2 IT Technologies Essay</b> - This channel was created to discuss
        the progress of the assigned essays to respective team members. The ‘Files’
        tab within it contains draft essays, final essays and a recording of
        general help provided from team members to others.</li>
      <li><b>A2 Project Idea</b> - This channel was created for the purpose of
        discussing the ‘Project Idea’ component of the assignment. We have found
        that communicating within this channel proved difficult because it was
        difficult to view replies from other team members. Therefore, for project
        idea discussions, chat was used between team members as it was more fluid
        and easier to catch up on messages missed by team members. The ‘Files’ tab
        within it was meant to store working documents of the ‘Project Idea’ but
        instead, the General -> Files tab was used.</li>
      <li><b>A2 Webpage Design</b> - This channel was created for the purpose of
        discussing the webpage’s look and feel. Team members made decisions based
        on votes. The ‘Files’ tab within it was used to store general files
        relating to the webpage design. Files for the webpage were stored in a
        GitHub repository.</li>
      <li><b>Stand-Up Meetings</b> - This channel served the purpose of the team’s
        ‘meeting room’ to schedule meetings and discussing their agendas. The ‘Files’
        tab within it stored the agendas, minutes, meeting recordings, and agendas
        and meetings templates in their respective folders.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p><b>Tools we have used within Microsoft Teams:</b></p><br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Polly</b>
        <ul>
          <li>To determine the best choices. i.e. theme colours, logos, team names and meeting times.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Tasks by Planner and To Do</b>
        <ul>
          <li>As a task list to track remaining tasks and deadlines.</li>
          <li>As a Kanban board for agile project management.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>SharePoint</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Uploading and sharing of files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Microsoft Excel</b>
        <ul>
          <li>For data analysis purposes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Microsoft Word</b>
        <ul>
          <li>For document creation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Chat</b>
        <ul>
          <li>For general communication purposes, to update each other on work done.</li>
          <li>As most of the team’s more natural conversations took place here,
            the chat’s history became lengthy, and the team found that it was very
            difficult, if not impossible, to export the chat log. The team has
            concluded that, in future, discussions about specified project items
            must take place in their respective channels for the purpose of
            analytics tracking.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol><br>
    <p><b>Microsoft Teams Analytics</b></p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Teams channel analytics can be found in the following path:
        <ul>
          <li><i>Fully Developed – IIT Group -> Manage team -> Analytics</i></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The period for the analysis was between 12/09/2021 – 11/10/2021, as the only
        options available were ‘Last 7 Days’, ‘Last 30 Days’ and ‘Last 90 Days’. As the
        period for this project was 4 weeks. The most suitable time period’s analytics
        was ‘Last 30 Days’.
      </li>
      <li>The following view is a summary of the team’s analytics:</li>
    </ul><br>
    <img src="../images/others/tools/1.png" width="100%"><br><br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Summary</b>
        <br>From the following screenshot, it is observed that there were <b>5 users</b> which
        was representative of 5 team members active in this Teams group. <b>9 applications</b>
        were used within the channels, of which <b>5 applications were deemed most suitable</b>
        for the purpose of this project. It is seen that <b>0 meetings</b> were held which is
        incorrect, as a total of <b>5 stand-up meetings, 1 impromptu chat session, 1 Interview session</b>,
        and <b>1 essay help session</b> took place. A total of <b>9.09GB of SharePoint files</b> were stored
        within the channels’ ‘Files’.
        <img src="../images/others/tools/2.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Engagement</b>
        <ol type ="I">
          <li>From the following screenshot, it is observed that <b>58 posts</b> were made in all channels
            and a total of <b>515 replies</b> were made in response to the posts which makes it an average
            of <b>8.9 replies per post</b>. This signifies a high degree of responsiveness from team members.
            Out of the posts, <b>172 mentions</b> were used to prompt team members into action or to solicit a
            response. A total of <b>238 reactions</b> was observed in response to posts or replies which can
            represent the enthusiasm of the team members.<br>
            <img src="../images/others/tools/3.png" width="100%"><br><br>
          </li>
          <li>The following graph illustrates that while engagement numbers are high, the number of posts,
            replies, mentions and reactions show a decline after the first week. This was due to tasks
            being divided among team members and ‘chat’ between team members were introduced outside the
            channels. As it was easier to have conversations in ‘chat’, in-channel engagement reduced.
            However, due to the nature of ‘chat’, the chat history was impossible to obtain.<br>
            <img src="../images/others/tools/4.png" width="100%"><br><br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Users</b>
        <br>From the graph, it can be observed that even though the official start date of the project
        was after the 19th of September, this teams was formed on the <b>14th of September 2021</b> which signifies
        a high level of enthusiasm and positivity. The active users per day vary throughout this period however,
        it mostly tracks at <b>5 users active per day</b>. The dips usually occur on the weekends.<br>
        <img src="../images/others/tools/5.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Tasks</b>
        <br>The reasoning behind using a Kanban board to track the team’s progress was to immerse the team
        in the basics of agile project management. Kanban boards are widely used in software development
        companies to assist in a bird’s-eye view of project tasks, to limit overworking and to increase
        efficiency (Rehkopf 2019).
        <ol type="I">
          <li>‘Tasks by Task Planner’ was used to track our tasks. The board view was used. The following
            screenshot is a representation of how we tracked our tasks:<br>
            <img src="../images/others/tools/6.png" width="100%"><br><br>
          </li>
          <li>The pie chart in ‘Charts’ show the status of the tasks in the planner. As of 13th October 2021,
            the charts shows that there are <b>4 tasks not started, 2 in progress, 1 late task</b> and <b>60
            tasks completed</b> in the entirety of the project.<br>
            <img src="../images/others/tools/7.png" width="100%"><br><br>
          </li>
          <li>This bar graph shows the number of tasks completed by individual members. The graph did not
            represent the data accurately because a group members tasks completed did not show in this
            graph due to a bug in the application.<br><br>
            <img src="../images/others/tools/8.png" width="100%"><br><br>

    <!--Microsoft Teams End-->

    <!--Github Begin-->
    <h2>GitHub</h2><br>
    <p>The team used GitHub to store the images, CSS and HTML codes which formed the webpage. According to
      Jaehnig (2021), GitHub is a platform for storing, editing, and hosting code. It is widely used to host
      webpages, collaborating and organising projects between project team members. ‘Repositories’ are
      used to store code for projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Insights</b></p><br>
    <p><i>Link: </i><a href="https://github.com/GSMSands/fully-developed/pulse" target="blank">Pulse · GSMSands/fully-developed (github.com)</a></p>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/others/tools/10.png" width="100%"><br>
    <p>The period chosen for the insights represent the entire project length. From the image, it can be
      observed that excluding merges, <b>6 authors</b> have pushed <b>108 commits</b> to main and 108 commits to all
      branches. On main, <b>0 files</b> have changed and there have been <b>0 additions and 0 deletions</b> for the reason
      being that all branches which currently exist are even with main.
    </p><br>
    <p><b>Contributions</b></p><br>
    <p>The following graphs represent the aggregate number of commits made by team members.</p><br>
    <ol>
      <li>This graph shows that from 19th of September 2021 to 13th October 2021, the number of commits increased exponentially. This is due to nearing of the project’s due date.
        <img src="../images/others/tools/11.png" width="100%"><br>
      </li>
      <li>These graphs represent the amount of commits per team member. As Liane Wong (celestes23) was assigned
        the task of website creation, the graph representing her contributions appear conclude that she contributed
        the most, but this does not reflect her contributions versus her teammates’ as a whole as this repository
        was used mainly for website creation and storage of code.
        <img src="../images/others/tools/12.png" width="100%"><br>
      </li>
      <li>The following graph shows the increasing additions and deletions nearing the due date of the project.<br>
        <img src="../images/others/tools/13.png" width="100%"><br>

    <h2>Canvas</h2><br>
    <p>Canvas is a web-based learning management system (LMS) used by universities, schools and other institutions.
      Course content, resources, feedback and forums can be found in this application (RMIT University n.d.).
      As RMIT uses Canvas, this team, Fully-Developed was formed on Canvas.</p><br>
    <p>While Canvas was useful in the formation of the team, it was not used very often due to the nature of forums
      and the time it takes to receive a response from a team member. The following image is an example of
      the ‘Discussions’ landing page:</p><br>
