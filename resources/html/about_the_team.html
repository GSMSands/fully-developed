      <p>When coming up with our team name we asked everyone to come up with a
        few different possibilities. We then put it up to a vote, and eventually
        decided upon the name 'fully-developed'. Not only was this a name we felt
        comfortable using in case any future employers would see it but we felt
        that it encapsulated the end result of the process of becoming IT professionals
        with our end goal being 'fully-developed' in our learning and subject knowledge.
        We also saw it as the end goal of any project we build as aspiring to have
        it developed to its full potential as well as growing ourselves during
        this project timeline.</p><br><br>
