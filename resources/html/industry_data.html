    <h1>Industry Data</h1><br><br>
    <p>Analysis of the industry data from (Burning Glass Technologies 2018b) and
      (Burning Glass Technologies 2018d) shows that demand for these roles in the
      industry was high in 2018. All 5 of our team's ideal jobs are in the top
      10 of the Top Occupations List (Burning Glass Technologies 2018d), with
      Software developers being the #1 ranked occupation.
      <br><br>
      IT is a fast-moving industry with changes every day; given that the data
      from Burning Glass is already three years old, we sought to confirm if the
      demand for these roles was still strong in the 2021 context.  The National
      Skills Commission Occupation Matrix (National Skills Commission 2021a)
      confirmed these roles are still in high demand, with Software and applications
      programmers again ranked #1 for Information Technology occupations in Australia.

      <br><br>
    <p>In addition, the future for employees wanting to move into these ICT roles
      is bright. The Skills Priority List (National Skills Commission 2021b)
      released in June 2021 predicts strong future demand for all of our team's ideal jobs.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Given the #1 ranking for software developers in the occupation ranking above,
      it is likely that the skills required for those roles would also be in high
      demand.  We confirmed this assumption by comparing the required skills set
      for the team's ideal jobs with the Skills in Greatest Demand [Burning Glass 2018].
      Figure 1 below is a visual representation of this comparison, demonstrating
      that the developer rolls require most of the top 10 in-demand skills
      required for the IT industry.</p>
      <br>
    <center><img src="../images/others/IndustryData_Fig1_ITSkills.JPG" alt="IT Skills in Greatest Demand"
      width=100%><br><br>
    <p><i><b>Figure 1</b>: IT Skills in Greatest Demand</i></p>
    </center><br><br>
    <p>It is interesting to note that whilst the above list is an IT skills specific
      list; it also includes more generically transferable skills, such as building
      relationships, customer service, and business management. These transferable
      skills were repeatedly called for in our team's ideal jobs.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Some skills are explicitly required in the vacancy notices for the team's
      ideal jobs; however, many are also implied or come as a prerequisite to the
      skills called for explicitly. For example, none of the roles called for
      Microsoft Office, but it is a core requirement in order to demonstrate
      the following skills successfully:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Sound oral and written communication skills" (Job Vacancy - Systems Administrator 2021)</li>
      <li>"Collaborative attitude, Great communicator & problem solver.
        Has worked in distributed teams in the past and understands expectations
        with remote work" (Job Vacancy - Smart Contract / Blockchain Developer 2021)</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>It is challenging to identify the definitive top 3 IT-specific skills <b><i>not</i></b>
      required by any one of our ideal jobs. While not explicitly requested in any
      of the vacancies, Linux would still be required by some developers, depending
      on the environment they are working in.</p>
    <p>Oracle & SAP are also not specifically called for; however, as worldwide
      leading software products, experience using Oracle or SAP would be advantageous
      to applicants applying for any of the team's ideal jobs.</p><br>
    <p>The most in-demand generic skill identified by (Burning Glass Technologies
      2018a) is communication, and all 5 of the ideal jobs called explicitly for this skill:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>System Admin role "Sound Oral and written communication skills…" (Job Vacancy - Systems Administrator 2021)</li>
      <li>Senior Front-End Developer "Strong communication skills…" (Job Vacancy - Senior Front-End Developer 2021)</li>
      <li>Smart Contract/Blockchain Developer "…Great communicator…" (Job Vacancy - Smart Contract / Blockchain Developer 2021)</li>
      <li>Junior/Mid Game Developer "Excellent communication and ability to collaborate…" (Job Vacancy - Junior/Mid Game Programmer 2021)</li>
      <li>Product Owner "Strong Communication – both verbal and written" (Job Vacancy - Product Owner 2021)</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>As demonstrated in figure 2 below, very few generic skills are not required by our ideal job roles.</p>
    <center><img src="../images/others/IndustryData_Fig2_GenericSkills.JPG" alt="Generic Skills in Greatest Demand" width=100%>
     <br><br><p><i><b>Figure 2</b>: Generic Skills in Greatest Demand</i></p>
   </center><br><br>
   <p>Mentoring stands out as a skill not required by the roles; however, just as
     with the IT-specific skills, this is a skill that would be advantageous to any
     applicant.  English language skills are implied in the specific vacancy's
     identified for the team's ideal jobs; however, this is highly subjective to
     the role's location, so it may not be a requirement for a developer working
     for a company based in China, for example.</p>

    <h1>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</h1>
    <br>

      <h3>Aidan Colosimo-Petrasso</h3><br>
      <p>Looking over the data has shown me that the junior/mid game developer
        field is growing. Due to this and my general passion for games as a whole,
        my opinion on my job has not changed. I still think it is a fantastic
        field to get into, and I would love to focus my skills in that area or
        related areas when possible.</p>
      <!--Aidan End-->
      <br><br>
      <!--Gesina-->
      <h3>Gesina Sands</h3><br>
      <p>Based on the analysis of industry data provided, my ideal job has not
        changed. The technical skills required for the role of Senior Front-End
        Developer as well as supporting skills such as creativity, leadership
        qualities, and analytic skills amongst many others are all things that
        still appeal to me. <br><br>I believe it will be a rewarding and interesting area
        of Software Development to work in, furthermore, the job growth in this
        area is strong and this leads me to believe that it is also a practical
        area to focus on for future work potential.</p>
      <!--Gesina End-->
      <br><br>
      <!--Liane-->
      <h3>Liane Wong</h3><br>
      <p>Taking the data into account, the opinion of my ideal job – Product Owner
        has not changed. As I have a passion for organization, perhaps more
        emphasis could be put on developing communication and leadership skills.
        Depending on the industry, the technical skills a product owner needs
        will vary greatly.<br><br>
        For example, if I were to develop software in a mining
        company, the technical skills required would be different to if I were
        to develop software in a games company. However, aside from technical
        skills, product owners require empirical knowledge such as people management
        and being able to identify consumer needs which can only be derived from
        experience.</p>

      <!--Purdey-->
      <h3>Purdey Eades</h3><br>
      <p>Despite the optimistic future this data predicts for System Administrators,
        my opinion of the role has changed.  Not as a result of the Burning Glass
        data but as a result of undertaking this course.  The Introduction to
        ICT course has highlighted that I do not have a passion for the broader
        technical aspects of IT required to fulfil the systems administrator role.
        Instead, I would like to focus my future study expanding my skills in
        eLearning development.</p>
      <!--Purdey End-->
      <br><br>
      <!--Samuel-->
      <h3>Samuel Drew</h3><br>
      <p>The industry data presented for the blockchain position only confirms my
        opinion that software development in this field is showing great promise
        and growth with this emerging technology. However, having an extensive
        background in secondary education, I would like to find a position/opportunity
        that uses blockchain technology in this setting that will provide possibilities
        for students to be engaged and take ownership over their own learning.</p>
