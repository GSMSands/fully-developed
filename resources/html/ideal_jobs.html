    <p>The common theme across all the roles was a requirement for communication
      and teamwork skills. The advertisements used words like sound, effective,
      excellent & strong to describe the need for communication skills.</p><br>
    <p>Gesina, Sam & Aidan all chose developer type roles that required programming
      experience; however, the depth of experience varied between the three based
      on the seniority of the position.</p><br>
    <p>The Product Owner and Senior Front End Developer roles are both Senior
      roles requiring 3-6 years of experience. The junior programmer role is open
      to graduates, and the Sys Admin & Blockchain developer roles require
      1-2 years of experience.</p><br>
    <p>The Product Owner role was interesting in that Full Stack development
      experience was essential, yet at the same time not required for the position.
      The Product Owner is focused on product development and project management
      and needs a strong understanding of what is involved in the development
      process but isn't writing code themselves. Liane is the only member of the
      team currently working for an IT firm; although not in an IT role,
      however, we all share a definite aspiration to move into our respective
      ideal jobs, which has led us all to take on this degree.</p>
